# Hardware Report 
### Bill of Materials 

- <strong>MATLAB Software - $0 OR $100 maximum </strong>
    - (there are other packages for $20, $30, $40, etc.) 
    - It is free if you have a license through an institution. Without a license given by an institution, the version you will need to buy is MATLAB_R2022b or newer.
    
- <strong> Elevation Data Files & Data Server - $0 </strong>

- <strong> Prediction Data File - $0 </strong>

### Device Requirements 

- You will need a device that has <strong>32 GB RAM memory.</strong>
This is because the datasets are so large that the device you run the final function on will not be able to process the data unless it has 16 GB RAM or more. The ideal amount of memoery would be 32 GB RAM, but a 16 GB RAM works as well. 

- If your MatLab software crashes after a few times running through the script, reopen MatLab and run it again. This will not change anything, it just means that your device is struggling to process the amount of data ran through multiple times. The script will not be able to run more than once or twice on any device that has less than 16 GB RAM memory.
